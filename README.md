I competed in the NASA Space Apps Challenge in October 2023, specifically the challenge: A Marketplace for Open Science Projects. Our goal was to connect project creators with skilled, interested contributors to various open-source projects. Our website ProjectMatch allows aspiring collaborators to browse through projects they are interested in and connect with project creators by submitting an application listing their skills and areas of expertise. The source code can be found in the Project_Match folder.
